not to do:
    check for valid rolls.
    check for correct number of rolls and frames.
    provide scores for intermediate frames.

Scoring rules:
    each game has 10 frames
    bowler gets up to 2 throws per frame
    Frame score:
        if not all knocked down -> sum of the 2 throws
        if spare -> 10 + next ROLL
        if strike -> 10 + simple total of next two ROLLS
        if (spare || strike) && last Frame -> 10+ next one or two extra ROLLS

sample tests

    X X X X X X X X X X X X (12 rolls: 12 strikes) = 10 frames * 30 points = 300
    9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- (20 rolls: 10 pairs of 9 and miss) = 10 frames * 9 points = 90
    5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/5 (21 rolls: 10 pairs of 5 and spare, with a final 5) = 10 frames * 15 points = 150
